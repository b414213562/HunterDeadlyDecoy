For 2021-10-05 (today):
    Fix Lock system
    Bug:
        Health bar does not scale during preview
    Unlocking window while a decoy is active doesn't stop the timer.
    When dragging, use OnScreen helper to not let them drag it off the screen.

    "Always on top" option (Do 0x0FFFFFFF), vs 0-ish
    While in options:
        Debug toggle - turn off target changed spam!

    Radial cooldown:
        Thurallor: if you want to superimpose a "cooldown" overlay on the icon, you can use the built-in images 0x41007E70 through 0x41007E35 - Decoy Cooldown = 30 seconds
            Possible alternative to white countdown bar thing
        Thurallor: You can even apply a different color to it with SetBlendMode

    Move CreateDisplaySizeChangedNonsense() into own file, put callback back in,
    so it doesn't know about the specifics.

Later:

Add an opacity slider?
Change the image to reflect health status? (Exogenesis9: Doom-style healthbar. Image of the dummy gets more beat up at lower health thresholds.)

Use decoy icon for decoy, deadly decoy icon for deadly decoy.
Look up skill icons via API?
    For using Decoy vs Deadly Decoy

Scaling Scrollbar:
    Populate initial value based on save file WIDTH
    Update value if screen resolution changes
Screen Resolution change:
    Call :Redraw() again.

Scaling while timer is running messes with the timer, makes it a full bar and stops updating.
When scaling is < 1x (e.g.), timer bar seems to not update until half-way.

Add round() helper function, use on Scrollbar Label starting value.
Scrollbar value could be > 10 after resolution changes. Constrain value to [1,10] to fix.

Reorganize the code?

Don't disable all things when unlocking, just make it respond to mouse.
Make resizable through options panel. (Using stretching that Thurallor mentioned)
    Stretch only the image, so time/health bar can have finer resolution.


What level do you get when scaled for Epic Battles? Is it 100? Does the decoy match?
    Souruko: yeah you are right^^ i just checked with my hunter in a big battle. if i ask localplayer:GetLevel() i still get 130. dummy morale is 19350.

    Souruko: Level scaling you to level 100. Scaling down your equipment. Scaling your virtues down to at most rank 9,999. <- chat message to start scaling
    Souruko: Removing level scaling, returning you to your normal level. <- chat message to stop scaling


    What chat messages are used to start and end level scaling?

    Bazaquezufegs: You could try to detect the scaling effect on the player as a workaround
    Bazaquezufegs: Chat message or effect applied to player

Responding to Screen Resizes:

Thurallor â€” 07/16/2021
Hey, I'm not sure how complex you want to make your Opaque Quest Tracker plugin, but if you want to automatically respond to screen size changes, here is some code that adds a "SizeChanged" event to the "Turbine.UI.Display" object.  It exploits the fact (bug) that all "stretched" windows get "unstretched" (and generate a SizeChanged event) when the display size changes:
[1:28 AM]
-- Add the Turbine.UI.Display.SizeChanged event.
displaySizeListener = Turbine.UI.Window();
displaySizeListener:SetVisible(true);
displaySizeListener:SetStretchMode(0);
displaySizeListener:SetSize(1, 1);
displaySizeListener:SetStretchMode(1);
displaySizeListener:SetWantsUpdates(true);
function displaySizeListener:Update()
    displaySizeListener:SetSize(2, 2);
    self.ignoreSizeChangedEvents = 0;
    self:SetWantsUpdates(false);
    self.Update = self._Update;
    self.SizeChanged = self._SizeChanged;
end
function displaySizeListener:_Update()
    self:SetWantsUpdates(false);
    DoCallbacks(Turbine.UI.Display, "SizeChanged");
end
function displaySizeListener:_SizeChanged()
    if (self.ignoreSizeChangedEvents > 0) then
        self.ignoreSizeChangedEvents = self.ignoreSizeChangedEvents - 1;
        return;
    end
    self:SetSize(2, 2);
    self.ignoreSizeChangedEvents = 1;
    -- Need to wait until the next Update() cycle before reporting.
    self:SetWantsUpdates(true);
end
